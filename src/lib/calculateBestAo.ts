/**
 * Calculates the best average of X (AoX) from a given array of solves.
 * For averages, the best and worst times are removed, and the average of the remaining times is calculated.
 * DNF solves are always considered the worst times. If there is more than one DNF, the average is DNF (represented as 0).
 * If a DNF remains after removing the best and worst times, the average is DNF.
 * This function checks all possible windows of 'ao' consecutive solves and returns the best one.
 *
 * @param {Solve[]} solves - An array of Solve objects.
 * @param {number} ao - The desired average length (e.g., 3, 5, 12).
 * @returns {number} The best average of X (AoX) for the given solves.
